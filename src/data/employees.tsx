    { type: 'paragraph', content: 'This Shopify business shipped products to customers all over the world. Yet the real sales didn’t happen on the website; they happened in private Instagram DMs, one message at a time. After a single post by a big creator, his inbox could explode with five hundred people asking questions, choosing colors, checking prices, hesitating, disappearing.' },
    { type: 'paragraph', content: 'He tried to keep up – answering from the phone at dinner, before sleep, on weekends – but each unread chat became a small failure. He knew people were ready to buy. They just needed answers faster than he could type.' },

    { type: 'paragraph', content: 'At first, the founder did what most would do – he tried to throw people at the problem. Not a permanent team, just temporary chat operators he hired during peak moments, when influencers tagged the store and the DMs turned into a flood.' },

    { type: 'paragraph', content: 'To do this safely, we created a private testing space in Telegram. There, the founder spoke to the AI as if it were a real customer – asking tricky questions, changing his mind mid-conversation, hesitating, testing tone, pushing its limits.' },

    subtitle: 'Phone Call Attribution System',
    description: 'Phone calls are often the highest-intent leads, but most companies cannot attribute which campaign or source actually generated the call. As a result, phone-based conversions are treated as "blind spots" in marketing analytics. We implement call tracking using static and dynamic numbers so every incoming call is tied to a specific traffic source, campaign, or keyword. This enables full attribution for offline and online ads, giving a clear view of which channels actually produce paying clients.',
